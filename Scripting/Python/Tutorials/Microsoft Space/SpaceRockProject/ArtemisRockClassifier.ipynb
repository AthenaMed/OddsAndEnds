The rover will send a text document of the different types of rocks, which you'll need to parse through. Your friend tells you how the Python programming language can make the task much easier than doing it by hand, and more automated.\n",

    "In this module, you'll build a simple notebook with Python to complete the task. Along the way, you'll apply a variety of introductory computer science topics. You'll have the option to use Visual Studio Code with the Python extension or the Python notebook integration right here on Learn. Either way you will run the code and use pre-built functions that will help you complete this exercise.\n",
