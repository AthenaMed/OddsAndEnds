    "\n",

    "1. Data input: Data is read from somewhere, which could be data storage like a file system or a database.\n",
    "2. Processing: Data is interpreted and possibly altered to be prepared for display.\n",

Instead of working on data and taking it from one phase to the next, OOP tries to understand the world in which the data operates. It does so by *modeling* what it sees.\n",

    "### OOP modeling: Identify concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "During the modeling phase, you look at a description of a domain and try to analyze the text on what takes place. The first step is to identify actors. They're called actors because they *act* and perform an action. For example, a printer (actor) prints (action).\n",
    "\n",
    "After actors are identified, you look at *what* they do, which is their behavior. Then you look at descriptions of the actors and any data that's needed to carry out the action. Actors are made into objects, the traits are encoded as data on the objects, and the behaviors are functions that also get added to the object.\n",

    "### Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "So why use OOP? Why not use some other paradigm? To be clear, OOP isn't better or worse than any other paradigm. There are pros and cons to everything. OOP does have some nice benefits, and here are some of those benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data encapsulation**: Data encapsulation is about hiding data away from the rest of the system and only allowing access to parts of it. The reason is data holds state, and that state can be made up of one or more variables. If these variables need to be changed at the same time, you need to protect them and only allow access via public methods so that changes are made in a predictable way. OOP has mechanisms like access levels, where data that's on an object can only be accessed by the object itself or can be made publicly available.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Building large systems is a complex task, with many problems to solve. Being able to break down the complexity into smaller problems, to objects, means you can simplify the overall task.\n",
    "- **Easy to modify**: When you rely on objects and model your system with them, it's easier to track down what parts of the system need modifying. For example, you might need to correct a bug or add a new feature.\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Maintaining code in general is hard, and it becomes harder over time. It requires discipline in the form of good naming and a clear and consistent architecture, among other things. Using objects makes it easier to locate a specific area of your code that needs maintaining.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: An object's definition can be used many times in many parts of your system or potentially in other systems too. When you reuse code, you save time and money because you need to write less code and you reach your target faster."

People simply can't compete with software when it comes to speeding up a process in certain cases. Using OOP is as much a modeling exercise as it is about writing the code to implement its logic. Modeling is about learning to identify the actors, the data needed, and what type of interaction that's taking place. You can model a system just by reading a description of it.\n",

    "## Invoice management system case study\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a manual flow that many companies struggle with, namely, *invoice management*. Many companies receive invoices, and they need to be paid on time. Late payments incur late fees, which result in wasted money. Before an invoice can be paid, it must be *processed*. It's common for an invoice to pass through a few hands before it ends up being registered somewhere and payment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process usually starts with an initial sorting phase where the invoice is sent to the appropriate department. Next, the invoice is checked for correctness and then approved by someone who has the proper authorization level. Lastly, the invoice is paid. For a small business, the business owner might do all of the steps. In a large company, many people and processes might be involved, which makes invoice management a complex activity.\n",

    "What does this description have to do with OOP? If you took the preceding workflow, which is often a manual flow, and turned it into written software, the first thing you would do is try to model the system. With the context of invoice management, you can start seeing actors (objects), behaviors, and data by reading a description of the problem domain.\n",
